# day_planner

This is a planner to effectively manage the time of a busy professional.  Today's date will be displayed on the top of the page as well as an option to clear the schedule.  Below there are time blocks for the work hours of 8am to 5pm.  These time blocks are color-coded as present, past, and future.  Past blocks will be red, the present block will be yellow, and future blocks will be green.  If you click on a timeblock, you will be able to edit the textbox.  There is a save button to keep the text on the page when it is refreshed.
